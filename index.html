                <p>I was born in Vilnius, Lithuania where I lived, studied and worked before coming to the UK. I have
                    Master's degree in Art as a Painting Artist from the Academy of Arts in Vilnius and have been
                    practising as a an artist for over a decade. Art remains my interest and passion and is really
                    useful in my guiding work. <br>
                    I came to the UK 15 years ago and London became my home. <br>
                    Languages: English, Lithuanian, Russian. Institute of the Linguist Qualification to guide in
                    English.
                    Specialisation and interests: I specialise in royalty, arts and ancient civilisations.
                    Kensington Palace, the British Museum and the Victoria&Albert Museum are among my favourite sites
                    where I feel quite at home. <br>

                    Royalty is one of the subjects that intrigues visitors from overseas. I was intrigued by it as well
                    and during the last six or seven years I have been steadily learning about the history of the
                    English monarchy. I had a privilege to work at Kensington Palace for six years and I am thrilled to
                    take visitors there and share my knowledge.<br>
                    Since childhood I have been fascinated by ancient civilisations, and The British Museum is the place
                    where you can learn about them endlessly. I have been volunteering there since 2010 and occasionally
                    even spent a night at the museum among the Egyptian sculptures! <br>
                    I am also a member of staff at the V&A which is a real treasure trove for guides and for anyone who
                    is interested in art and style. I know this complicated building inside out and I keep exploring its
                    collections.<br>
                    Meeting people from various backgrounds and walks of life is a part of a joy of being a tour guide.
                    I like taking around individuals and small family groups, but I can work with large groups as well.
                    I enjoy working with people of various ages but I am especially good working with middle-aged and
                    older clients. I am very happy to do Highlight tours introducing people to major sites of London in
                    a short time. It is always exciting especially when you have first-time visitors. I have extensive
                    experience working with private tours, including VIP tours with chauffeur driven cars.<br>

                    Recently I completed an intensive four-day course of Windsor and Environs which gave me a much
                    deeper understanding of the Castle and its surroundings, including Windsor Great Park and Eton.</p>
